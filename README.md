This program was designed to do analysis on NSSF(Uganda) customer support data to find out if customers always get satisfaction

##DOCUMENTATION
Documentation related to this project can be found in the root directory of this repo.
I have uncluded a software requirements specification and a software design document.
That should be enough to get you started.
